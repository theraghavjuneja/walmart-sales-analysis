# 📈 Time Series Analysis and Visualization App

This Streamlit application provides interactive visualizations and analysis tools for time series data using ARIMA modeling, seasonal decomposition, and various plotting libraries.(Based on WalmartSales Analaysis)

## 🛠️ Requirements

Make sure you have **Python 3.7 or higher** installed. You can create a virtual environment if needed.

### 📦 Required Python Libraries

Install the following libraries using `pip`:

```bash
pip install streamlit pandas numpy plotly matplotlib statsmodels seaborn Pillow

This script uses the following libraries:

* `streamlit` – For building interactive web apps
* `pandas` – For data manipulation
* `numpy` – For numerical computations
* `plotly.express`, `plotly.graph_objects`, `plotly.subplots` – For interactive plotting
* `matplotlib.pyplot` – For static plots
* `statsmodels` – For ARIMA modeling and seasonal decomposition
* `seaborn` – For statistical plotting
* `io`, `base64` – For in-memory file and image handling
